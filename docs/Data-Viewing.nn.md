## Live mÃ¥linger

Page\: `Data -> Live Measurements`

The `Live Measurements` page is the first page a user sees after logging in to Mycodo. It will display the current measurements being acquired from Input and Function controllers. If there is nothing displayed on the `Live` page, ensure an Input or Function controller is both configured correctly and activated. Data will be automatically updated on the page from the measurement database.

## Asynchronous Graphs

Page\: `Data -> Asynchronous Graphs`

A graphical data display that is useful for viewing data sets spanning relatively long periods of time (weeks/months/years), which could be very data- and processor-intensive to view as a Synchronous Graph. Select a time frame and data will be loaded from that time span, if it exists. The first view will be of the entire selected data set. For every view/zoom, 700 data points will be loaded. If there are more than 700 data points recorded for the time span selected, 700 points will be created from an averaging of the points in that time span. This enables much less data to be used to navigate a large data set. For instance, 4 months of data may be 10 megabytes if all of it were downloaded. However, when viewing a 4 month span, it's not possible to see every data point of that 10 megabytes, and aggregating of points is inevitable. With asynchronous loading of data, you only download what you see. So, instead of downloading 10 megabytes every graph load, only ~50kb will be downloaded until a new zoom level is selected, at which time only another ~50kb is downloaded.

!!! note
    Graphs require measurements, therefore at least one Input/Output/Function/etc. needs to be added and activated in order to display data.

## dashbord

Page\: `Data -> dashbord`

The dashboard can be used for both viewing data and manipulating the system, thanks to the numerous dashboard widgets available. Multiple dashboards can be created as well as locked to prevent changing the arrangement.

## Widgets

Widgets are elements on the Dashboard that have a number of uses, such as viewing data (charts, indicators, gauges, etc.) or interacting with the system (manipulate outputs, change PWM duty cycle, querying or modifying a database, etc.). Widgets can be easily rearranged and resized by dragging and dropping. For a full list of supported Widgets, see [Supported Widgets](Supported-Widgets.md).

### Custom Widgets

There is a Custom Widget import system in Mycodo that allows user-created Widgets to be used in the Mycodo system. Custom Widgets can be uploaded on the `[Gear Icon] -> Configure -> Custom Widgets` page. After import, they will be available to use on the `Setup -> Widget` page.

If you develop a working module, please consider [creating a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature-request.md&title=New%20Module) or pull request, and it may be included in the built-in set.

Open any of the built-in Widget modules located in the directory [Mycodo/mycodo/widgets](https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/tree/master/mycodo/widgets/) for examples of the proper formatting. There are also example Custom Widgets in the directory [Mycodo/mycodo/widgets/examples](https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/tree/master/mycodo/widgets/examples).

Creating a custom widget module often requires specific placement and execution of Javascript. Several variables were created in each module to address this, and follow the following brief structure of the dashboard page that would be generated with multiple widgets being displayed.

```angular2html
<html>
<head>
  <title>Title</title>
  <script>
    {{ widget_1_dashboard_head }}
    {{ widget_2_dashboard_head }}
  </script>
</head>
<body>

<div id="widget_1">
  <div id="widget_1_titlebar">{{ widget_dashboard_title_bar }}</div>
  {{ widget_1_dashboard_body }}
  <script>
    $(document).ready(function() {
      {{ widget_1_dashboard_js_ready_end }}
    });
  </script>
</div>

<div id="widget_2">
  <div id="widget_2_titlebar">{{ widget_dashboard_title_bar }}</div>
  {{ widget_2_dashboard_body }}
  <script>
    $(document).ready(function() {
      {{ widget_2_dashboard_js_ready_end }}
    });
  </script>
</div>

<script>
  {{ widget_1_dashboard_js }}
  {{ widget_2_dashboard_js }}

  $(document).ready(function() {
    {{ widget_1_dashboard_js_ready }}
    {{ widget_2_dashboard_js_ready }}
  });
</script>

</body>
</html>
```
